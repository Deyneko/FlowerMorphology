<b><i>FlowerMorphology</i>: fully automatic flower morphometry software.</b>

<i>FlowerMorphology</i> is an all-in-one software to automatically image and analyze flowers. Twelve directly measured parameters and ten novel composite characteristics of a flower allow characterization and classification of plants with high accuracy.
<p>Using genetically similar polyploid series of Nicotiana tabacum L. plants, we could quantify the dependency between the polyploidy and size and form of the tobacco flowers. We found that only radius of inner petal incisions shows persistent growing trend towards higher chromosome number. Our novel parameters of flower shape evidently show that the polyploidy leads to significant aberrations in flower symmetry. 
<p>The program is easily adjustable for the analysis of any flower.
<p>More about scientific part of the program is in the upcooming article...
